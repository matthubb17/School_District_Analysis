# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to help, Maria to analyze data on student funding along with analyzing students test scores. As a result of some potential academic dishonesty at Thomas High School, I was instructed to rerun the data and to omit the data that could be a result of academic dishonesty.

## Resources:

**Data Source:** [Resources](https://github.com/matthubb17/School_District_Analysis/tree/main/Resources)

**Software:** Python 3.9.7, Jupyter Notebook

## Results:

As a result of the potential academic dishonesty at Thomas High School, I replaced the math and reading scores with NaNs for all 9th graders at the school. 

* By removing the 9th graders scores for both math and reading we saw the below changes to the data for Thomas High School:
	- The passing percentages of Thomas High School fell due to omitting the scores.
	- The average scores for Thomas High School also fell as a result of omitting the scores.
	- The district did see a slight decrease in both the average math and reading scores as a result of this potential academic dishonesty.
	- Despite some changes we did still see the school rankings for top 5 and bottom 5 remain unchanged as Thomas High School still fell in as the 2nd highest performing school.


## Challenge Summary:
